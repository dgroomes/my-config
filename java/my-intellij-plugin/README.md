# my-intellij-plugin

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

My personal IntelliJ plugin.


# Overview

I don't have much to put in an IntelliJ plugin, but I want a "copy the names of the open files" feature so that I can
bundle up files into a context that I'll use in an AI chat.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and use the plugin:

1. Use Java 21
2. Build the plugin and run it
   * ```shell
     ../gradlew runIde
     ```


# Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Scaffold
* [ ] IN PROGRESS Implement
   * Wow, Claude Sonnet 3.5 one-shotted a working action... I want to clean it up, convert it to Kotlin, reconsider the
     language and UX, but that was really cool.
